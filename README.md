# Metrics

This module enables prometheus metrics for Caddy.

## Use

In your `Caddyfile`:

~~~
prometheus
~~~

For each virtual host that you want to see metrics for.

It optionally takes an address where the metrics are exported, the default
is `localhost:9180`. The metrics path is fixed to `/metrics`.

With `caddyext` you'll need to put this module early in the chain, so that
the duration histogram actually makes sense. I've put it at number 0.

## Metrics

The following metrics are exported:

* caddy_http_request_count_total
* caddy_http_request_duration_seconds
* caddy_http_response_size_bytes
* caddy_http_response_status_count_total

Each counter has a label `host` which is the hostname used for the request/response.
The `status_count` metrics has an extra label `status` which holds the status code.
